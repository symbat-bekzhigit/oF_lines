# Assignment 2 

For this assignment, since the main goal was to focus on the concepts of animation and motion I decided to make a little animation consisting of circles and blocks moving along the path by relying on the physics concepts of real life.

***How I came up with this idea?***

I was just seaching through different examples of animated art made in OpenFrameworks (made a google search, then looked at the works of OF artists who we're familiar with - [Zach Lieberman] (https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/animation.html) and [Junkiyoshi] (https://junkiyoshi.com)). After that, I started looking at different kinds of addons that we can use for making animation in OpenFrameworks at the [addons library] (https://ofxaddons.com/categories). After getting inspired by some of them, I tried to make several mini animations and see how it goes: my original idea was to utilize the concepts such as vector and noise to make an animation of a growing tree but then I decided to give up on this idea because in the porcess of maing it I realized that I need to utilize a lot of vectors for that and that that would be energy consuming and simple, unless I decide to add something else at the background. So, I switched to exploring the addons. I looked at ceveral of them but ofxPlaylist and ofBox2D caught my attention. After playing around with the examples provided in the documentation of each of the addons I decided to use ofxBox2D addon in this assignment as it perfectly fitted the description of the assignment.
