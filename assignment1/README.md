# Assignment 1 - "Solar System"

For this assignment, since the main goal was to use shapes and colors in a way that together they communicate something more, I decided to make a layout of the Solar System. 

How I came up with this idea?

At the very early stage of my branistorming, I searched for different kind of projects done using openFrameworks on the web, in a hope that I'll get inspired by some of them. Most of the projects that I saw were great but they seemed to be hard to implement. So, I decided to change my strategy and look at the projects of particular artists in this field. That is when I recalled the artist named JunKiyoshi, who was in our Weekly Schedule, because his works seemed to match the level of the project that I could implement. I browsed through his works on his website and was inspired by the work called "Planter" https://junkiyoshi.com/2021/04/09/, particularly by the curves surrounding the edges of the cube, and the ides of using various curved/straight lines to replace the edges of some geaometrical shapes. But, even though I wanted to follow a similar idea in my code, I still didn't have a concrete image in my mind of what I wanted to implement.

Then, I continued browsing through the examples and concepts provided in our Weekly Schedule, and something clicked when I stumbled upon the project called "trigonometryExample" from week 4 https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master/examples/math/trigonometryExample . After seeing how a small cyan circle moved along the larger yellow circle, I suddenly got an idea of making a solar system, where every planet moves around the Sun along a fixed orbit, just as a cyan circle moves along the circumference of the yellow circle.


How my progress looked like?

Now that I knew what I wanted to do, or at least try doing, all that was left was to write the code. 
As with all the big assignments, I decided to stick to the principle of "Divide & Conquer" which is very commonly used by computer programmist when designing complicated algorithms. I decided to first draw the sun and one planet moving around the circle in an elliptical orbit.
